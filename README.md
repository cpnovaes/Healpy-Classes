## Healpy Classes

##### I am gathering here all the material prepared for the course offered in 2017. The course is mainly focus on HEALPix/healpy. We first see the whole concept behind this pixelization scheme, and then I show ONE OF the ways you can install the "Healpy", the python version of the HEALPix, in unix system.

### We use:
##### python3
##### healpy version 1.9.1

### Note:
##### I am not using the last healpy version. Ih you are using a newer version you can find small inconsistencies when running the example codes. I will try to update the material according to the last version of the healpy as soon as possible. Feel free to contact me with questions.
